Overview

Part 1: Bivariate Normal Distribution
Implements the Bivariate Normal Distribution from scratch using the Iris dataset (UCI ML Repository). Covers parameter estimation (mean, standard deviation, correlation), PDF computation, and visualizations including contour plots and 3D surface plots.

Part 2: Bayesian Probability
Applies Bayes' theorem to the IMDB movie reviews dataset for sentiment analysis. Computes prior, likelihood, marginal, and posterior probabilities to determine the probability of a review being negative given certain keywords.

Part 3: Gradient Descent
Implements gradient descent optimization from scratch, demonstrating how the algorithm iteratively minimizes a cost function.

Part 4: Additional ML Concepts
Explores further machine learning topics building on the foundations from the previous parts.
